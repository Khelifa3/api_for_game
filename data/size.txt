It looks like youâ€™re trying to convert a curl request to Python code. I'll generate a Python script that replicates this request using the requests library. I'll ensure all headers and cookies are included.

It looks like you're trying to send a cURL request to Expedia's GraphQL API, possibly to fetch hotel-related data. However, the request contains a significant amount of cookies, headers, and query parameters, making it difficult to parse directly.

Key Observations:
Authentication & Session Tokens

The request includes multiple authentication-related cookies (EG_SESSIONTOKEN, DUAID, _abck, etc.), which are likely required for Expediaâ€™s servers to recognize your session.

These tokens might expire or be tied to a specific session, making reuse difficult.

GraphQL API Call

The content-type: application/json header suggests that you may need to send a JSON payload with the request body.

The absence of --data or --data-raw flags means this cURL command might be incomplete.

Expediaâ€™s Anti-Bot Measures

There are headers such as bm_sv, _abck, and ak_bmsc, which indicate the use of bot mitigation techniques like fingerprinting or request validation.

If you're encountering access issues, Expedia may be detecting this request as automated traffic and blocking it.
