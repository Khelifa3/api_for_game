## BRICKS PARTNERSHIP EVALUATION

1. **Compatibility Assessment**:
   HyperIP shows minimal compatibility with BRICKS services at this time due to the absence of demonstrated community engagement and lack of evidence indicating interest in physical merchandise or fan rewards. Their platform-centric approach appears primarily focused on digital/blockchain interactions rather than physical fan connections.
