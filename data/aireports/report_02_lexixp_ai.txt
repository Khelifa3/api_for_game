The small follower count (378) may not provide sufficient scale for an effective merchandise program.

While Lexi XP has a distinctive gaming-focused identity that could translate well to merchandise, there is no evidence of community interaction or interest in physical products. Additionally, the relatively small follower base (378) suggests limited distribution potential at this time. A successful merchandise partnership requires demonstrated community engagement and a more substantial follower base.
