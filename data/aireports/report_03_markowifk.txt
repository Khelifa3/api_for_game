## BRICKS PARTNERSHIP EVALUATION

1. **Compatibility Assessment:**
   Marko shows limited compatibility with BRICKS services at this time. His focus is primarily on technical expertise and professional thought leadership rather than community building or fan engagement through merchandise. There are no indications he is seeking to expand his personal brand through physical products, and his relatively small follower base might not generate significant merchandise demand.

2. **Implementation Examples:**
   - If interested, Marko could identify highly engaged technical contributors in Twitter discussions and reward them with branded notebooks featuring AI security concepts or TEE architecture diagrams.
   - He could offer exclusive chess-themed merchandise (as he mentions being a "Frustrated Chess Player") to community members who contribute significantly to technical discussions about AI security.

3. **Recommended Merchandise:**
   - Tech-focused notebooks with security architecture diagrams or technical concepts related to TEEs
   - Chess-themed mousepads featuring AI/blockchain concepts or the Oasis Protocol logo
   - Minimalist coffee mugs with clever AI security or "p(doom) = 20%" messaging

4. **Compatibility Rating:**
   Partnership Potential: 3/10

   While Marko is a respected professional in his field, the current evidence suggests he is not focused on merchandise or physical fan engagement. His modest following, technical focus, and lack of brand development signals indicate this isn't an optimal partnership at this time. His engagement is primarily informational and professional rather than community-building or brand-focused.
