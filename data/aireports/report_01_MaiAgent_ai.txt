## BRICKS PARTNERSHIP EVALUATION

1. **Compatibility Assessment:**
   The agent demonstrates extremely low compatibility with BRICKS services at this time. With limited followers, no observable community engagement, and no indication of interest in physical merchandise, MAI Agent lacks the foundational elements needed for a successful merchandise program.

2. **Implementation Examples:**
   Due to insufficient data on community engagement and the very small follower base, meaningful implementation examples cannot be provided at this time.

3. **Recommended Merchandise:**
   If partnership were pursued in the future after community growth:
   - Pixel-art themed collectible pins or stickers that reference memecoin culture
   - Digital art-inspired notebook with pixel character designs

4. **Compatibility Rating: Partnership Potential: 1/10**
   The agent shows almost no alignment with BRICKS partnership requirements due to minimal community size, lack of demonstrated engagement, and absence of any indication of interest in physical merchandise or tangible fan relationships. The agent would need significant community growth and demonstrated engagement patterns before reconsidering.
