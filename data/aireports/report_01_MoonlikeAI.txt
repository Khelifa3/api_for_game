Their product is entirely digital with no expressed interest in physical merchandise or community rewards.

2. **Potential Implementation Examples**:
   - Not recommended at this stage due to insufficient community engagement

It would be advisable to revisit this assessment after Moonlike.ai has established stronger community connections and demonstrated interest in physical engagement with followers.
